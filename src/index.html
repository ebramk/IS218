        <h1> Ebram Kerolos's Website </h1>
	<p> My name is Ebram and I was born and raised in Egypt, specifically,
	Upper Egypt. We moved to the United States in 2008, when I was about 11
	years old. We lived in Jersey City, New Jersey ever since. I went
	straight to P.S. # 24 and after graduating from 8th grade, I went to
	James J. Ferris High School, located on Montgomery Street in Jersey
	City, NJ. After High School, I started my Computing Sciences journey at
	NJIT

<blockquote>My major at NJIT is Information Technology, with a minor in
Computer Science along with another minor In Web and Information Systems. With
the help of all the NJIT professors and all of the knowledgeable people there,
I am anticipating to become an Information technology professional. I would
like to work in something like server or database administration Iâ€™m currently
a junior taking 18 credits.</blockquote>
